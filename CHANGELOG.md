# N.O.D.E Changelog

## N.O.D.E v2.2s
**Final release.**<br>
**Release Date:** Nonexistember ??, 20XX

### General Additions
<!--
- **Added an update checker function! (wow, finally)**
  <br>If a new update has been detected, N.O.D.E will notify you at the bottom of the screen, right above the Welcome text.
  You may ignore the update for the current session or turn the update checker off.
  Note: The update checker might not work if you are using the SWF version.
- **Technical:** Added a "Fork" variable to aid with auto-update-checking if you wish to fork NODE despite the fact that Flash is dead.
  This separates the nodeWorkstationVersion and your fork.
-->
- **Brought back the Level Variable generator.** 2-path levels are now supported, and presets actually work.

### Workstation Additions
<!--- //Added a "Flip-Hidden" Node function - useful for 2-2 maps or symmetrical 1-1s that have an intersection where one (part of the) path is above the other instead of marking both areas as hidden. (examples being Pillar of Osiris).
  When the path has been mirrored or flipped either way, the copied Flip-Hidden nodes will be switched from either Visible or Hidden.-->
- **Added Warp Node support!** Luxor 2 modders, this is for you.
  <br>After placing a warp node, N.O.D.E will automatically change to Hidden mode.
  <br>Press X to toggle Warp Mode.
- **Added an experimental Show All Vertices function!** This uses ActionScript line methods.
  <br>Using lines for the dots instead of drawing individual boxes eases load, though vertices that are close to eachother will look "connected". I tried drawing individual boxes per vertice - it works, but it made N.O.D.E laggier the more vertices you add. :s
- **Added a Sparkle exporter!** Use N.O.D.E for both Luxor and Sparkle mods!
  <br>N.O.D.E will use positive Y-values for this one, as Luxor and Sparkle treat negative Y values differently.
  <br>To export your map as a Sparkle map, hold Alt and click Save. It's quite barebones, though!
- **Mirrored path creation!** Easily make maps like Ra's Journey to the West and Nepthy's Garden! They can be found in Edit Mode under Path Augmentation > Mirror.
  <br>Keep in mind for mirroring paths by 180Â° or mirroring paths vertically that the program assumes that your path is properly aligned in the first 500 pixels (i.e. path is centered vertically in a 800x500 area). Since N.O.D.E is for Luxor anyway. 
- **Added Ctrl+Z support.** Delete vertices with the well-known Undo shortcut! (only has support for vertice undoing. making an undo list would be very tricky, AND unlikely)
- **Added Ctrl+S support.** Easily save your maps!
  <br>Ctrl+Alt+S shortcut for Sparkle map export.
- Added warnings for soft limits in the Stage Mapper (logger only).
- More funni easter eggs. Find them yourself.
- Guess who's back, back again! Re-added Cowlppy in both Workstations (i felt bad for him)

### Bugfixes
- SM Discord button was clickable in Instructions.
- Clicking the Close button in the Instructions dialog didn't go back to page 1.
- Path preview color preview squares in the N.O.D.E Settings menu didn't go away when settings are reset.
- "Please switch to Trace Mode" log message was being triggered twice when you hold down the mouse and release it, causing it to duplicate. Now it respects your settings.

### N.O.D.E Changes
- The vertice limit is now 1000 instead of 999 vertices. (since obj faces are counted from ONE, dammit!)
- Changed Map Name functionality: textbox is toggleable. When editing the map name, hotkeys are disabled.
- Changed Custom Cursor behavior: focusing on the sidebar will now hide it (and vice versa).
- Fixed text box font oversights in the Import Path screen.
- Fixed font oversights in the Map and Stage Map editors.
- Fixed GVF output (removed leading whitespace and set Min/MaxScales to 1.00)
- UI/UX touchups, generally makes everything darker. ~~And look like a BeardLib Editor ripoff!~~
- Minor code optimizations.

### Projector Changes
- Removed built-in menu bar.
- Removed all Flash built-in shortcut functionality, including full screen, next/previous frame and zoom. (Hell yeah!)

### Removals
- Removed leftover music and Random Path Generator code.
- Removed leftover assets from previous versions.

## N.O.D.E v2.1c
**Release Date:** November 20, 2020
### Changes
- MASSIVE UI overhaul, getting rid of an inconsistent and messy UI.
- The EULA has been shred; N.O.D.E now uses GPLv3 with direct permission from the author and is also now open-source.
- Changed texture of sphere cursor and the latest placed vertice cross.
- Initialization now checks if you have a username set instead of checking for user volume.
- Default color is now #2182e5. You can also find this in the Presets.
- Preset color #3d3c3a is now #161616.
- Logger color no longer saves for the current N.O.D.E session when Save is not confirmed.
- Original placeholders for the background and stage_select image have been added.
- Removed mod showcases from instructions (most of them got cancelled or whatever)

### Additions
- Added the ability to customize the Visible and Hidden path line colors.
- Added the ability to set Path Preview Thickness with options of 2 (default), 4, 6, 8, 16 and 32.
- Resetting your data in the Settings menu now ask for confirmation before proceeding. (finally!)
- Added the spr and tga files of the top facing pyramid.

### Removals
- Removed ALL music tracks, which decreased the SWF file's size from 277 MB to 4.42 MB (!!)
  <br>Fun Fact: The fla source file was 1.3 GB - removing those tracks shrunk it to 23.9 MB!
  This removes the vol, tracklist and track commands and the jukebox.
- Removed the ability to pause the editor.
- Removed the Random Path Generator.
- nunya and rowlet/cowlppy have been removed. Yes, Cowlppy had to go. He felt too old to be in N.O.D.E, so old that Konis doesn't even use him as his profile picture anymore! :(
  - Fortunately, Cowlppy's legacy lives on as the outline in the icon.
- The Level Var generator and Luxor 3 segment generator have been removed (or rather, inaccessible by normal means).

### Known Bugs
Major:
- All known major bugs for current features fixed as of v2.0

Minor:
- if there is no background.jpg file in the N.O.D.E folder, N.O.D.E will show
  0% when importing the image. In a .swf file, an error will be returned.
- .exe version cannot import image if path directory contains Unicode symbols.
- when pasting a long vertice list into Import Path, the text will be invisible
  if it is too long. This does not affect importing, thankfully. As of v1.2, the
  textbox has been lengthened to attempt to prevent this as much as possible, and
  tested so that one of the longest Luxor vertice lists, Scroll of Thoth, works
  fine. However, vertice lists with estimated more than 500 vertices, especially
  those with decimals, may still turn invisible when pasted into the text box.
- The saved settings are stored as seperate cookies for the swf and exe files.
- when right click is followed with a Settings command, the mouse cursor will be
  visible with the custom cursor. This is fixed the moment a left click input
  is registered.
- bug regression: Path Importer doesn't load Node=HIDDEN values for non-N.O.D.E
  path.obj files in v1.3 & v2.0: tunnels cannot be imported for non-N.O.D.E paths.

## N.O.D.E v2.0
**Release Date:** 1 Mar 2017
- added Show Vertice Path function to draw a line/curve showing the level path.
