Nocturnal Owl De-vertice Editor is a program that provides a custom workstation for simplifying the process of creating your own paths for Luxor, and more!

## Why should you use N.O.D.E?
* simplifies the path making process by automatically logging vertices with asimple mouse click instead of the old copy and paste method.
* reduce human errors in path making by having N.O.D.E generate the path.obj,map.ui and stage_select.uis file output for you.
* curved paths and corner vertices are MUCH easier & less time consuming to map.
* drastically speeds up path making and hence, the mod creation process.
* imports paths from other Luxor games for you to edit easily!
* new features are constantly being updated and added.
* a logger to replace Clippy.
* completely freeware. Credit to me and N.O.D.E in your mod is optional.

I hope that with the release of this program, custom paths will be much less time consuming to make, which will hopefully make the process of path modding less daunting, which means more people will get into the marble popper modding community, and possibly revitalise the genre through fan level mods.

*Marble poppers were a dying niche. They were popular in the 2000s but have all but died out with the turn of the decade. Interest in them has however been revived through the Sphere Matchers community, whom decoded how the .obj path files work in Luxor, allowing it to be edited for custom paths. (I think the main reason is people wanted to try to make more challenging paths)
So, I tried dabbling into modding Luxor Amun Rising paths myself but along the way I realised that with the current method, it is extremely tedious to copy the node points one by one from GIMP to Notepad. Hence, me being lazy, I decided to streamline the process. While coding a reverse face-path app, I caught the attention of site administrator Bobik, whom suggested a full custom application for custom node tracking. After chatting via PM the concept turned into the full fetched Luxor path creator
you see today, N.O.D.E!*

Ever since it's v1.0 beta release on 13 Aug 2016, N.O.D.E has been an invaluable tool for every Luxor modder. It is now highly likely to be used for making maps for almost every Luxor mod.

How to Run N.O.D.E:
For Windows users, open the "Nocturnal Owl Devertice Editor.exe" file. That's it! N.O.D.E should be running.
If the .exe file doesn't work or if you are a Macintosh user, open the "Nocturnal Owl Devertice Editor.html" instead with a Flash player-enabled older browser instead. If the .html file is slow to load, open the .swf file.

For more trouble queries, head down to the Readme file's "Section IX. Troubleshooting".

That's the basics! This is a readme file, I've kept it brief, so don't expect
too many details.
For more details on how to use N.O.D.E, please use the actual "Help" function
in the program.
