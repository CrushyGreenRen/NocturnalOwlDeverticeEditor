feel free to improve my code n shit here

maybe stuff like a "make vertices from #160 to #170 hidden" fn or toggle show all vertices, i havent got around to making that and i dont have all the time in the world cus yk

and i also wanted to change the show all vertice colors for the hidden/warp nodes, pretty confusing as of now so treat 2.2s as a nightly release

feel free to improve on the sparkle exporter as well and btw these two buttons on the workstation were supposed to be tabs for edit mode to say, make vertice # hidden or warp, basically "Vertice Augmentation", "Path Augmentation" etc basically making it a budget ripoff of BeardLib Editor loma

i wanna help somehow even if i cant be active much here
